# Solenoid Electromagnetic Field Simulation

## Description
This project presents a simulation of the electromagnetic field generated by a solenoid. Using MATLAB, it visualizes the magnetic field lines and intensity around a solenoid, providing an insightful tool for educational purposes or for those interested in electromagnetic field studies.

## Features
- Visualization of magnetic field lines around a solenoid.
- Analysis of field intensity and distribution.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB

## Installation and Setup
Ensure you have MATLAB installed to run this simulation.

1. Clone the repository to your machine:
git clone https://github.com/julenHopp/solenoid_electromagnetic_field_simulation.git
2. Open the files in MATLAB.

## Usage
Run the main simulation script in MATLAB to start the simulation. The program will display the electromagnetic field around the solenoid, with options to adjust parameters such as the number of turns in the solenoid, current magnitude, and others, to see their effect on the field.

## Contributing
If you have ideas to improve the simulation or add new features, your contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests for any enhancements you make.
